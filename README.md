# Firefox 52

Unfortunately, ItÂ´s not possible anymore to enable NPAPI using a Firefox version older than 52.Please be aware that Firefox autoupdates by default, so more often than not, you need to uninstall first to install an older version.

Download Firefox version 52 for your OS here: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/52.0/ and install the software. Please make sure to `disable the maintenance service` in the installation wizard.


# Google Chrome 44.0.2403.157 for Windows

This is the final version of Google Chrome with NPAPI.

To download, click "44.0.2403.157_chrome64_installer.exe" for 64-bit and the other for 32-bit, and click "Raw".

Uninstall Chrome if you have 45 or later. Opening the file while 45 or later is installed will simply open Chrome.

Note that if in Settings > On startup, you selected "Continue where you left off", restarting with Chrome 44 may cause all tabs to be unresponsive. You might think Chrome is broken, but it is not. Newly created tabs will function normally. Simply go to the unresponsive tab, copy the current URL, and open a new tab with that URL.

VirusTotal (32-bit): https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/8dfb7731392718399aa94a58d572e58b0bae7bee98baab3c011ef6b433afdfca/analysis/1441920616/

Note about the 32-bit: The 32-bit installer did not reside on any of my computers. I acquired it from: http://www.neowin.net/news/google-chrome-4402403157; direct download: http://redirector.gvt1.com/edgedl/chrome/win/F24BEBCD670E2ACB/44.0.2403.157_chrome_installer.exe. I did not test its functionality, but the VirusTotal scan says it should be safe.
